# 📥 Insertion Sort

This Python function implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order. Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one item at a time, placing each new element into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

## 📜 Function: `insertion_sort`

### 📝 Description
The `insertion_sort` function iterates through each element of the array. For each element, it compares it with the previous elements in the sorted portion of the array and inserts it into the correct position, shifting other elements as needed.


# Sample array
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]

# Expected output:
Sorted array using Insertion Sort: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
